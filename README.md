Portfolio sites are vital for freelancers working in the digital age. While all freelancers can hand out business cards and certain freelancers, such as
photographers, can distribute physical portfolios to potential clients, a portfolio website provides a way for any freelancer in any industry to reach more 
clients on a global scale. It also provides a way for you to get creative with the information and intricate details you share about yourself and your work.
